# jquery_task_Scandiweb
Task is to create a valid jQuery plugin, which adds placeholder  functionality for input and textarea elements. Plugin should auto initialize itself for all input and textarea elements, which have data placeholder attribute.
Please note, that main aim of this plugin is to add placeholder functionality for browsers, which  do not support it by default, like IE8, so for all other browsers this plugâ€‹in should fall back to  default placeholder attribute.
